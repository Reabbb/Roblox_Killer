# Roblox_Killer

This is a very simple basic C++ program that detects the process ID of the Roblox client and terminates it. This can be useful as sometimes Roblox is buggy and doesn't fully close. This would lead to you going to your task manager and finding the hidden Roblox client and manually terminating the program itself which can be annoying. To bypass this, this program will automatically resolve this Roblox glitch.
