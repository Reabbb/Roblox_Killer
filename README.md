# Roblox_Killer

This is a very simple basic C++ program that detects the Roblox client's process ID as well as terminates it. This is useful because Roblox is occasionally buggy and does not always fully close. This would necessitate you to open your task manager, locate the hidden Roblox client, and manually terminate the program, which can be inconvenient. This software will automatically resolve this Roblox glitch to get around it.

Compile with Visual Studio.
